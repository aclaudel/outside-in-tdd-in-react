# Outside-In TDD in React

## Kata

- A login page with just one login button
- Once clicked, a loading screen will appear while fetching some data
- When ready, the data will be displayed
- Each item will have a delete button that will remove it

## Goals

- Build the ui logic without any concern about layout, styling etc.
- Only assert component interactions, conditional rendering and properties
